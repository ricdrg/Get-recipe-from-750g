The purpose of this project is to use web scrapping methods to get recipes
from a french cooking website (750g.com) because I love cooking :) !
The requirements : beautifulsoup, requests and lxml modules

1째 prompt user to type the recipe wished
2째 find a match from datas types by the user
3째 getting web page informations
4째 sort it to a csv or a GUI

Currently the only step done is the web scrapping part.
